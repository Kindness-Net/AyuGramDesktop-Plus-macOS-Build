# AyuGram Desktop Plus macOS builds

This repository hosts the macOS build workflow and dependency cache for [AyuGram Desktop Plus](https://github.com/Kindness-Kismet/AyuGramDesktop-Plus). Releases are coordinated and published by the source repository.

The source repository dispatches an exact commit and Release workflow run. This repository builds the Intel and Apple silicon packages, keeps its own GitHub Actions caches, and returns short-lived artifacts with provenance manifests. It does not publish releases.

Pull requests only validate workflow syntax. The signing key is scoped to the dispatched build workflow and is removed from the runner workspace after each build.

Trusted manual builds from non-main source branches remain supported. The selected source commit must include `scripts/build_provenance.py` and the Packer `ccache:disable` guard.
